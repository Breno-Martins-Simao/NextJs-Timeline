# Space, Time and Your Memories
This project is a Timeline platform where you can save your best memories that remember your achievements, learning and experience through your life.
The applications was built using the following stack:
- A web application using **React/NextJs (./web)** [Web Interface]('./FakeUrl')
- **Typescript/Fastify (./server)** for a [Backend API Service]('./FakeUrl')
- **React Native (./mobile)** for a [Mobile app]('./FakeUrl')

# How should you use this repo?
This repo represents all the SpaceTime Application ecossystem, so if you want to run the any of the **frontend plataform** you **MUST** also run the **Backend API**. You can check how to run each application through their readme.md
