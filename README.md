# Space, Time and Your Memories
This project is a Timeline platform where you can save your best memories that remember your achievements, learning and experience through your life.

# Timeline Architecture 
The applications was built using the following stack:
- A web application using **React/NextJs (./web)** [Web Interface]('./FakeUrl')
- **Typescript/Fastify (./server)** for a [Backend API Service]('./FakeUrl')
- **React Native (./mobile)** for a [Mobile app]('./FakeUrl')

These three applications can be deployed at separate containers/server, but both frontend ones (Mobile and WEB) must be abble to connect on the backend API

# How should you use this repo?
This repo represents all the SpaceTime Application ecossystem, so if you want to run the any of the **frontend plataform** you **MUST** also run the **Backend API**. You can check how to run each application through their readme.md in their respective folders.
